Subject: [PATCH 4/4] BF: use build_*_2to3 if in _2to3

On Debian systems py helpers first do python setup.py build
so conversion should happen then.  Manual invocation of
./fail2ban-2to3 is least preferred since modifies in place
and would require additional special handling to monitor
changed files etc
